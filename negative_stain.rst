Negative stain
==============

Choice and preparation of negative staining reagent
---------------------------------------------------

For staining macromolecules and their complexes, uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are the most common choices, as they give good contrast and rapid fixation.

Choice between the two uranyl stains is a trade off between visual quality and ease of use:

* Uranyl acetate is more easily prepared and can be stored for up to a year
* Uranyl formate is prone to precipitation during preparation, and lasts only a few days (perhaps up to a week). However, in TEM images it has a noticeably smaller "grain size" and so gives better detail.

By default, if your macromolecule is stained by UChicago EM facility staff, uranyl formate will be used unless otherwise specified.

Uranyl stain preparation protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uranyl acetate is typically used at 1% (w/v) in water. Uranyl formate is typically used at 0.75% (w/v) in water.

#. Bring an excess (at least 20 mL) of ultrapure water to a boil, and allow to boil for 5-10 minutes to de-gass.
#. Once off the boil, in a new vessel, use the hot de-gassed water to dissolve the appropriate mass of uranyl stain powder. Because uranyl formate only lasts a few days, and thus there's no point in making up large volumes, we usually use 37.5 mg in 5 mL of water.
#. **For uranyl formate only:** Add 12 μL of 5M NaOH, or equivalent. Do this slowly: while stirring with a stir bar, and/or a drop at a time accompanied by mixing. The solution should turn a darker yellow. If precipitation occurs, discard the solution and start over - you were too fast or added too much.
#. Once cooled enough to do so safely, filter the solution through a 0.2 μm syringe filter.
#. Store at 4C in a vessel totally protected by light, e.g. wrapped in aluminum foil.

Discard the stain if you see any precipitate or brown discoloration (it's not salvageable after this point, filtering it again won't rescue it). Uranyl acetate typically lasts for months to a year, uranyl formate for a few days to a week.


What grids? Negative stain edition
----------------------------------

Negative staining provides massive contrast and requires a continuous carbon surface, and is not generally used for large scale automated data collection. As a result, grid robustness can become a main priority: no holes, a thick carbon layer, and 400 mesh.

We recommend the "CF400-Cu" product from EMS, listed here: https://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/products/grids/carbon.aspx


Negative staining protocol
--------------------------

Materials
^^^^^^^^^

* Filter paper, optionally cut into small (say, 1 cm) squares/triangles depending on your preferred workflow
* Uranyl stain
* TEM grids with a continuous carbon surface, freshly glow-discharged
* Negative pressure tweezers
* Optionally: parafilm, depending on your preferred workflow
* Optionally: another pair of regular fine tweezers

Procedure
^^^^^^^^^

There are many similar protocols for negative staining available. The basic flow of any negative stain protocol is sample absorption -> washing -> staining.

#. **Set up** your parafilm + stain droplets and water wash droplets or water-filled pipette ahead of time, fresh for each grid.
#. **Sample absorption:** Grab a fresh grid in negative pressure tweezers and rest, carbon side up, on the bench-top. Apply 3.5 μL of sample to the carbon side of the grid. Wait between 0 and 60 seconds for the sample to absorb to the carbon surface. Draw away excess sample by touching the side of the grid to fresh filter paper.
#. **Washing:**

	a. **Option 1:** Holding the tweezers so that the grid is angled at about 45° facing away from you, cascade multiple drops of ultrapure water from a pipette across the grid surface. Draw off remaining water off with fresh filter paper.
	b. **Option 2:** Place two 50 μL droplets of ultrapure water on a parafilm sheet. Touch the grid surface to a droplet. Surface tension will let you lift off a small bit of water onto the surface of the grid; draw water off with fresh filter paper. Repeat with the other parafilm droplet.

#. **Staining**: Place two or three 50 μL droplets of stain on a parafilm sheet. Touch the grid surface to the stain drop, lift a bit of stain off on top of the grid, and draw off excess with fresh filter paper. Repeat with the other stain drop(s). Note: this is the same action as the Option 2 wash step above, just with stain instead of water.
#. Allow the stain to fully dry for at least 10 min before inserting into an electron microscope. 

.. admonition::
   "Blotting" during negative staining
   
   Between the steps listed above, you are touching the edge of the grid to filter paper to remove the vast majority of fluid from the grid surface. Keep in mind that this is **not** intended to utterly dehydrate the grid surface. Doing so before the sample is fixed by the stain would be quite detrimental to your sample! The goal is rather to create a very thin film: move briskly and draw away only as much liquid as a gentle side-touch to filter paper can remove!

The combined effects of sample concentration × incubation time will determine the resulting density of particles on the grid.
